The purpose of this document is to explore a data set of $20,000$
seismic events obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey.

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(tidyr, , warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
seismic <- read.csv("seismic_data.csv")
dim(seismic)
summary(seismic)
```

Definitions of these terms can be found
[here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/glossary.php).

Several of these variable describe the measurements and not the
seismic event, so we'll reduce the data set.

```{r warning = FALSE}
seismic <- seismic %>%
    select(-magType, -nst, -gap, -dmin, -net, -updated) %>%
    mutate(type = factor(type))
numeric.cols <- sapply(seismic, function(col) is.numeric(col))
numeric.cols[2:3] <- FALSE
cor(na.omit(seismic[numeric.cols]))
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = type, fill = type)) + geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

We can see that the vast majority of events are earthquakes. Let's
take a look at any relationships between our variables.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggpairs(seismic[, numeric.cols])
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = mag)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.25) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = depth)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 15) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = rms)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.2) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
```

The overwhelming number of earthquakes is making it difficult to
examine the properties of our other variable types. One option would
be to examine the other types without the earthquakes.  This, however,
might be too drastic in that we won't be able to find relationships
between earthquakes and our other variables.

By mapping the data, a more interesting solution presents itself.  It
looks like the only place where the reporting networks gave us
non-earthquake events is in the continental United States.  If we want
to find relationships between the event types, it might be wise to
restrict our sample to only those events which occurred in this
region.

```{r}
seismic <- seismic %>%
    filter(latitude < 49,
           latitude > 18,
           longitude < -63.37,
           longitude > -124.6) %>%
    mutate(type = factor(type))
summary(seismic)
numeric.cols <- sapply(seismic, function(col) is.numeric(col))
numeric.cols[2:3] <- FALSE
cor(na.omit(seismic[numeric.cols]))
```

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = type, fill = type)) + geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

While we still mostly have earthquakes, we do see a higher proportion
of other events.

Now that we've restricted our sample, we can try the graphs again.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggpairs(seismic[, numeric.cols])
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = mag)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.25) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = depth)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 15) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
ggplot(seismic, aes(x = rms)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.2) +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
```

We certainly see more of the variability in our variables with this
restricted sample. For tasks like predicting an event type, this will
be essential.
